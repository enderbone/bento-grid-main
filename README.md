## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned how to use grid and media querrys in CSS. This will help me alot in future projects when i need make responsive sites.

### Continued development

Make the text responsible is a challange. Making the text break at some specific points and only at some specific moments, without using width is complicated for me. I managed to find a way to solve the problem, but I'm almost sure it's not the most efficient way.
